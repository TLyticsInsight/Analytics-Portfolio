Independent Data Analysis Learning

## Independent Data Analysis Learning

Since July 2023, I have been actively expanding my skills in data analysis through independent study and preparation for future projects. Key activities include:

### **Current Skills & Learning Progress**

#### **📊 Data Analysis & Statistics**

- 🎯 **Google Analytics 4 (GA4) Certified** – Web analytics and data-driven marketing insights
- 📖 **Statistics Background (University & Independent Study)**  
  Studied fundamental statistics in university courses (2017, 2020). Currently integrating statistical concepts into Python (pandas, NumPy) for data analysis.

#### **💻 Programming & Tools**

- 🐍 **Python for Data Analysis (Learning & Application)** – Utilizing pandas and NumPy for data processing and statistical analysis
- 🗄️ **SQL – Practicing Essential & Advanced Queries (PostgreSQL)**  
  Practicing on a cloud-based database environment with SELECT, WHERE, LIKE, IN, ORDER BY, CASE, COUNT, MAX, DISTINCT, GROUP BY, JOIN, INNER JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, COALESCE, and CASE WHEN.
- 🌐 **WordPress (Setup & Maintenance)** – Experience in site creation, updates, and migrations
- 🔄 **Server Migration (without Domain Transfer)** – Hobbyist experience migrating WordPress sites, manually handling DNS settings, database transfers, and configuration adjustments.

#### **🛠️ IT & Infrastructure Knowledge**

- 🌍 **Networking & ISP Experience** – Hands-on experience with ISP-related support, troubleshooting, and network configuration (ADSL, ISDN, Fiber Optics)
- 📞 **Technical Support & Training** – Experience as a supervisor handling customer support, troubleshooting, and staff training
